# AppDev Cloud Services Training: Day 4

We are half way to having an api with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)
functionality. We have the CR. The `POST` method allows us to _create_ new
tasks and the `GET` HTTP method allows us to _read_ a list of tasks. Now we
have to add in the UD. The `PATCH` HTTP method will allow us to _update_ our
tasks and the `DELETE` method lets us spawn swarms of bees. jk. `DELETE` is
for _deleting_. Along the way to implementing these, we will notice duplicate
code and learn strategies to avoid repeating ourselves.
