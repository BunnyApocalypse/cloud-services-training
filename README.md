# AppDev Cloud Services Training: Day 7

Right now, we have one really big file with a lot of copy-pasted code. That
is a good indicator that it is time to refactor. Refactoring is the process
of reorganizing code without changing its behavior. Today in training, we
will go through that process, and learn ways to organize code as our projects
grow.

## Readings

* [Express router](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router)

* [A video discussing some programming philosophy](https://youtu.be/H5FdjjEjdZ4?t=2m58s)
  * I set it to start at 3 minutes. The minutes before are interesting too, but
    not relevant to today's training.
