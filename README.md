# AppDev Cloud Services Training: Day 2

Day two is docker day. Docker can be a pretty tricky if you are new to
programming. It might not even make sense why we need it. We will try to
demystify it in class, but full mastery will take time.

## Readings

These readings are aimed more towards experienced developers, but they will help
familiarize you with some of the concepts and terminology.

* [Understanding and getting started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
* [Containerizing your app](https://lockmedown.com/docker-4-devs-containerizing-app/)
