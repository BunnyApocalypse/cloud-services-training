# AppDev Cloud Services Training: Day 6

Right now, we are suffering from a limitation of JavaScript: it is hard to
tell what data type anything is. In some ways, this is a good thing, because
we don't have to obsess over all the minutia that PM loves so dearly. Still,
knowing the types of certain things can be really helpful. We have a few
tools at our disposal.

## Readings

The debugger built into VSCode and some other editors like WebStorm is really
fantastic for looking at the values of variables while your code is running.
We will set it up today.

JSDoc is a tool that allows us to indicate the types of variables in code
comments, so our autocomplete works nicer.

* [Basics of JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html#adding-documentation-comments-to-your-code)
* [Types in JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/tags-type.html)

OpenAPI schemas, among other things, allow us to make sure the user sends us
exactly what we expect, so we can give more helpful errors when they don't
and improve security.
