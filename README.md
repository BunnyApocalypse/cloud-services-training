# AppDev Cloud Services Training: Day 7

Right now, we have one really big file with a lot of copy-pasted code. That
is a good indicator that it is time to refactor. Refactoring is the process
of reorganizing code without changing its behavior. Today in training, we
will go through that process, and learn ways to organize code as our projects
grow.

Right now, we are suffering from a limitation of JavaScript: it is hard to
tell what data type anything is. In some ways, this is a good thing, because
we don't have to obsess over all the minutia that PM loves so dearly. Still,
knowing the types of certain things can be really helpful. We have a few
tools at our disposal.
