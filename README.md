# AppDev Cloud Services Training: Day 8

With our API resilient to problems, it's about time we started writing
documentation for how to use it. Normally, we would do documentation first so
we can communicate better with the Android and iOS teams, but for purposes of
this course, we have put it off until now. OpenAPI is a tool for describing
precisely how an API works. We will set it up today.

Also, don't be confused. **Swagger = OpenAPI**. OpenAPI used to be called
Swagger, they are the same thing.
