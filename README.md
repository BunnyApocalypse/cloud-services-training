# AppDev Cloud Services Training: Day 3

It is time to start saving our data somewhere. The piece of software responsible
for storing data in a fast and organized fashion is called a database. We will
be using a database tool called MongoDB. This will allow us to send real data
from our api, and allow users to modify that data to add or check off tasks.

## Readings

* [MongoDB docker image documentation](https://docs.docker.com/samples/library/mongo/)
* [MongoDB quick start](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.2/quick-start/quick-start/)
