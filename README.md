AppDev Cloud Services Training
==============================

Welcome to AppDev training!  We are excited that you chose to learn about cloud services, and we hope you enjoy the training.  Please read through these instructions to get an idea of how this course works, and don't hesitate to reach out to Zander if you are confused about anything.

## How This Training Works

This repository will serve as the website for the training.  There is a section (also called a branch) for each day.  You can jump to any section in the [table of contents][#table-of-contents] below.  Each section has the recommended readings to be done before the session that day, as well as starter code for that day for reference.  Generally, you shouldn't replace the code you already have with our starter code unless you miss a day of class.  It is better for you to get used to your own code.

## Getting Started

**If you know nothing about git or GitHub**, or maybe you just aren't very confident with them, then don't worry.  We will learn some of the basics later in this training, but for now, you can just download [the starter code for day 1][day1] as a .zip file with the green download button in the top right.

**If you are already familiar with git and GitHub**, you should have no problem getting started.  Just clone this repository and switch to [the day-1 branch][day1].  We recommend that you then split off a new branch from there, just in case you want to refer back to day 1 at some point, but that is up to you.

### Required Tools

You should try to install all of these before the first day of training.  If you have trouble getting any of them working, you can get help on the first day.

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) lets us use code published by other people.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) allows us to run our code on any system we need to.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), or if you already have a favorite code editor, you can use that instead.
