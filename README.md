# AppDev Cloud Services Training: Day 1

This is the first day of class, so we won't do anything too crazy. Our main
focus will be ensuring that everything is installed properly and understanding
the core concepts behind web development. Additionally, we will be starting to
use Yarn and Express, two big tools, to get a server running.

## Readings

As with all readings in this training, these readings are recommended but not
required. Readings will help you to be more prepared for training sessions and
to extend your understandings beyond what we can cover in a limited class time.
Do them if you have the time, but you should be okay if you can't.

* [How does the internet work?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work)
* [Getting started with Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started)
* [Getting started with Express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)
* [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html)
  * This is an excellent, beginner-friendly book for JavaScript. It is a lot to
    read all at once. Consider skimming it for concepts you are confused on as
    we move through the course, if you don't have time to read the whole thing.
